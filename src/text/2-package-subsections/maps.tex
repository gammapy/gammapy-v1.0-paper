The \code{gammapy.maps} sub-package provides classes that represent data
structures associated with a set of coordinates or a region on a sphere. In
addition it allows to handle an arbitrary number of non-spatial data
dimensions, such as time or energy. It is organized around three types of
structures: geometries, sky-maps and map axes, which inherit from the base
classes \code{Geom}, \code{Map} and \code{MapAxis} respectively.

The geometry object defines the pixelization scheme and map boundaries. It also
provides methods to transform between sky and pixel coordinates. Maps consist
of a geometry instance together with a Numpy data array containing the corresponding
map values. Map axes contain a sequence of ordered values which define bins on
a given dimension, spatial or not. Map axes can have physical units attached to
them, as well as define non-linear spaced bins.

The sub-package provides a uniform API for the FITS World Coordinate System
(WCS)~\citep{Calabretta2002}, the HEALPix pixelization~\citep{Gorski2005} and
region-based data structure (see Figure~\ref{ig*:minted:gp_maps}).

% itemize because it helps me write, could also just be paragraphs...
\paragraph{WCS:}
The FITS WCS pixelization supports a different
number of projections to represent celestial spherical coordinates in a regular
rectangular grid. Gammapy provides full support to data structures using this
pixelization scheme.

\paragraph{HEALPix:}
This pixelization provides a
subdivision of a sphere in which each pixel covers the same surface area as
every other pixel. As a consequence, however, pixel shapes are no longer
rectangular, or regular. \gammapy provides limited support to HEALPix-based
maps, relying in some cases on projections to a local WCS grid.

\paragraph{Region:} In this case, instead of a fine spatial grid
dividing a rectangular sky region, the spatial dimension is reduced to a single
bin with an arbitrary shape, describing a region in the sky with that same
shape. Typically they are is used together with a non-spatial dimension, for
example an energy axis, to represent how a quantity varies in that dimension
inside the corresponding region.

Additionally, the \code{MapAxis} class provides a uniform API for axes representing
bins on any physical quantity, such as energy or angular offset. The special
case of time is covered by the dedicated \code{TimeMapAxis}, which allows time bins to
be non-contiguous, as it is often the case with observation time-stamps. The
generic class \code{LabelMapAxis} allows the creation of axes for non-numeric
entries.
