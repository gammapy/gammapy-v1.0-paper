One of the most common analysis cases in gamma-ray astronomy is measuring the
spectrum of a source in a given region defined on the sky, in conventional
astronomy also called aperture photometry.
The spectrum is typically measured in two steps: first a parametric
spectral model is fitted to the data and secondly flux points are computed
in a pre-defined set of energy bins.
The result of such an analysis performed on three simulated CTA observations
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cta_galactic_center}.
In this case the spectrum was measured in a circular aperture centered
on the Galactic Center, in \gammaray~astronomy often called "on region".
For such analysis the users first chooses a region of interest
and energy binning, both defined by a `RegionGeom`.
In a second step the events and instrument response are binned into
maps of this geometry, by the `SpectrumDatasetMaker`.
All the data and reduced instrument response are bundled into a
`SpectrumDataset`.
To estimate the expected background in the on region a "reflected regions"
background method was used~\cite{Berge07}, represented in \gammapy
by the `ReflectedRegionsBackgroundMaker` class.
The resulting reflected regions are illustrated for all three observations
on top of the map of counts.
After reduction of the data it was modelled using a forward-folding
method and a power-law spectral shape, using the `PowerLawSpectralModel`
and `Fit` class.
Based on this best fit model the final flux points and
corresponding log-likleihood profiles are computed using
the `FluxPointsEstimator`.
